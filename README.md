- **Shroud & Dart Gate**
- - New barrel shroud with picatinny and a quick swap barrel collet.
- - New dart gate. This dart gate keeps the barrel stationary, instead of letting it move like on a stock Wasp 76. 
- - THE DART GATE MUST BE USED WITH THIS SHROUD. The shroud can be used with the standard moving dart gate, but it isn't as nice as my new dart gate.
- - No decrease in performance, increase in accuracy. 
- - Shroud closely follows the contours of the orginal shell middle section.

- - Makes it a LOT easier to insert mags.

- - Work in progress
